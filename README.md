# novelty-distill

Reproducible baselines for measuring how supervised and knowledge-distillation methods change scientific-idea quality and mode coverage.

See [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for the baseline matrix and Turing execution order.

The project uses official upstream implementations pinned in `third_party/manifest.yaml`. SGLang is the inference engine for teacher generation, evaluation sampling, and judge serving; training remains in the official TRL/OPSD/GEM/DistiLLM stacks.
